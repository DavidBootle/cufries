## Background

This project was built for CUHackIt 2023. We wanted to create simple web application that has wide appeal, and that Clemson students would find useful. We noticed that a staple dish for students at the dining hall was the french fries. Who doesn't love french fries? They serve all different types at the three different dining halls, and everyone has their preference.
